# Introduction
This project aims to provide a FastAPI-based API for credit scoring using machine learning models. Users can make POST requests to get credit score predictions based on various input parameters. The project includes the integration of machine learning models for credit scoring using XGBoost and SHAP explanation for model interpretation. The `__init__.py` file is part of the project structure, contributing to the functionality of the FastAPI-based API.

# Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Usage
To use the project:
1. Ensure the project is set up on your local machine.
2. Make a POST request to `/predict/` with a JSON payload containing the required input parameters.
3. The API will return a credit score prediction based on the provided input.

# Features
- FastAPI framework for building efficient APIs.
- CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests.
- Integration of XGBoost for machine learning credit scoring models.
- Utilization of SHAP for explaining model predictions.

# Configuration
The project can be configured by adjusting the CORS origins, methods, and headers in the `main.py` file.
